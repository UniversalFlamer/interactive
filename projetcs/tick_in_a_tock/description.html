                <p>
                    A: This is a clock displayed in pixels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing you should notice is that it refreshes just like mostly how our screens do (and very likely yours, too)!

                <p>This shows <span>the sequence of the pixel change</span>(also konws as the screen refreshing).</p>
                <p>So generally speaking, a pixel is the most primary display unit of a screen and a screen need to change all of pixels very swiftly to display different things( like your cursor moves and also a clock!)</p>
                <p>So, the whole idea is inspired by its timings. If we can see the refreshing process slow down, it will bring very unique visual effect!</p>
                <p>By the way, here are some more specific details about the timings.</p>

                <p>Q: What does kisou.club means?</p>
                <p>
                    A: Kisou is derived from a Japanese word 奇想(きそう,kisou), meaning magnificent and unique imaginations. So generally it is a club about kisou and this website is supposed to be a place of what I created fun or cool or whatever.
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Q: What is the name?</p>
                <p>A: I call it "A tick in a tock".</p>
                <p>
                    It is generally a clock but you may ponder do we need another "clock" to control the timings and sequences? The answer is yes! Just like most digital devices with complicated timings, there is a superior, fatser clock to manipulate everthing! So I guess it is pretty fun to know that it is not only a single clock but a clock inside another clock! The inner clock ticks, and one pixel changes and tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, the similar process iterates and finally you can visually discern it is a pixel clock! 
                </p>
                <br>
                
                
                <p>Q: What should I do?</p>
                <p>
                    A: Well, the refreshing rate is very low (approximately 0.002315Hz for a frame or one pixel refreshes per second.). You can either change it to a very high value and just use it as an normal digital clock or you can keep the refresh down and enjoy the unique visual effect ---- since the refreshing is so slow, the number can not be changed within one second or even one minute, depending on your rate, you can see numbers mixed together creating some kind of new characters! (Like picture below!)

                <p>
                    Q: How do you feel about the project?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: It feels great!
                    It is my first time to learn webpage design! It is soooooo cool! It is like, you can draw or create something with your keyboard and pen and imagination and many otherthings! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, by the way, being not a English native means sometimes it is really hard for me to convey my ideas clearly. Fortunately, I think the final webpage is kind of self-explaining as long as you watch patienly enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hosting the website on my own domain name and VPS is also a challenging job. I spent many time in configuration so as to make it work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, about the clock itself, it gives me very unique feelings about it. An oscillator clock on the mainboard drives your computer and operating system and then the operating sysytem actually keeps other time amnagement of the processes, including your browser. Inside your brouser, a timer is always synchronising everything and finnally you can see the clock. If you have a deeper vision of the whole process, seeing pixels changing could be something symbolic, representing a complicated and fascinating structure. It just reminds me how we build computers from simple material to complicated programmes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh! By the way, seeing refreshing slowing down is fun. You just need to wait patiently enough, and explore the mixed or imcomplete numbers. 
                </p>
