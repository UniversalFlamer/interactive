<h2>Indian foods!</h2>
    <p>
Today my friends and I went to Sherkaan, an Indian restaurant. Foods there is really spicy. We had enjoyed the the Orka fries(some kind of fried dumplin, staffed with mutton)and the Dum Biryani(just chicken curry rice). Though they differed a lot from the cuisine style of my hometown but it is still very delightful to gormandize a pile of rice!
