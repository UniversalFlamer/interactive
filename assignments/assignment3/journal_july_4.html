        <h2>My progress in HTML&CSS</h2>
        <p>
          This morning I went to the Good Nature and experienced the exotism of America. The only familiar thing is Itoen(A tea drink producer from Japan) and I was overwhelmed
          And I found something pretty intersting: the boxed water. Back in China mineral water are never sold in boxes so I bought it and started to HTML-ize it for the assignment 2.

        <h2>A little Adventure in East Asian Library</h2>
        <p>
        It is funny to know there is an East Asian Library in Yale. I took a little trip in it and I have to say to see a row of stacks flooded with Chinese Characters, Kana, Hangul and Latin alphabets is a brand-new experience since it is a rare combination to see.
        I found an interesting book about Kamon!
