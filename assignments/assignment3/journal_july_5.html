        <h2>Nuisance calls</h2>

        <p>I got a phone call from the so-called China Consulate in New York and was told I was involved with an identity theft crime. Such a typical phone scam!</p>

        <p>I have to say it is literally the first time of my whole life to encounter a scam phone call and I was totally shocked how fast my private information leaked away in America! It was like only my fifth day in North America and there were already nuisance calls!</p>

        <p>I can hardly imagine how they got my private information since it's only the sixth day the SIM card activated and only a small group of people are supposed to  know the number. This fact is kind of terrifying me.</p>
