     <h1> My quotes and notes for <span style="font-style: oblique">A Vernacular Web</span></h1>
    

    <p style="font-style: oblique;font-size: 10px">Also new amateur pages don't appear at such amounts as ten years ago because the WWW of today is a developed and highly regulated space. You wouldn't get on the web just to tell the world, "Welcome to my home page." The web has diversified, the conditions have changed and there's no need for this sort of old fashioned behavior. Your CV is posted on the company website or on a job search portal. Your diary will be organized on a blog and your vacation photos are published on iphoto. There's a community for every hobby and question.</p>
    <p>This is very true. I have learnt how Pgae Rank algorithm works and those self-hosted, independent webpages can easily be hidden at like 20th page in the Google search results. And among my classmates in China, most of us are encouraged to put our CV on Linkin and little of us make our onw webpage.</p>

    <h5>Some notes:</h5>
    
    <p>Under Construction Sign promises that this page will grow and there is "Always Under Construction." sign. </p>
    <p>Spcae background Small in size and giving futuristic mood</p>
    
    
    <p>As we're reminded by the various "Best Viewed With..." buttons, the choice of browser was a big aesthetic and philosophic issue for web makers.</p>
    <p>I do not know how to such a remarkable extent browsers diverge in the past!</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Links attached to the page used to play a big role in post-search-engine era!</p>

<h1> My quotes and notes for <span style="font-style: oblique">Vernacular Web 2</span></h1>   
    <p>Home pages turns into journals, profiles, personal spaces. They are sometimes considered uncool and a startpage with contents maybe more attractive. </p>
    
    
    
    <p>Glitters a trademark of today’s amateur aesthetics and Starry backgrounds represented the future, a touching relationship with the medium of tomorrow. Glitter decorates the web of today, routine and taken-for-granted.</p>

 <h1> My quotes and notes for <span style="font-style: oblique">Top 10 Web Design Styles of 1993 (Vernacular Web 3)</span></h1>
    
<p>1. End User equals designer in the past, when there are a lot Pf. Dr. pages and all the pages maybe look samely simple.</p>
    
    
    <p>2. In the Pf. Dr. era, web design is really simple. Like there are only 216 web safe colours.(Though later background is developed for better design.) Also, animated gifs are makeing pages more vivid.</p>
    
    <p>3. Modern web is deviating from the idea of "interlinked documents". We do not surf but search. I guess this what we call "hyper" but this is not what we call "text". I think the main idea of the passage is internet really changed a lot and old good days of classic webpages ended.</p>
  
<br>
     
    
 <p style="font-size:40px;font-style: italic">My question for three above all: So if web design has changed so much today, why we need to focus on those "ancient" pages?</p>

<h1> My quotes and notes for <span style="font-style: oblique">What is code?</span></h1> 
    
    <p style="font-style: oblique;font-size: 10px"> Programmers are often angry because they’re often scared. We are, most of us, stumbling around with only a few candles to guide the way. We can’t always see the whole system, so we need to puzzle it out, bit by bit, in the dark.</p>
    <p>Among my classmates, it is like everyone is learing the most popular languages like python and java. And I do concern if something I like will no longer prosper oneday. I like Mathematica but it seems Matlab really prevails.</p>

    <p>Manifesto for Agile Software Development is very intriguing to me, though I have not participated in such a developing process. But the idea is pretty important here, more communication and flexible schedule to changes and focus on the working software itself. However, I am kind of confused with the word "agile"? Why this manifesto is described to be about agile? I think humanistic and realistic may be more proper. It is like it focuses on the communication between people and avoiding aimless pursuit for the so-called schedule.</p>
